# 🚀 Beginner Kafka Message Streaming with Python

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates how to set up Kafka for **sending and receiving messages** using Python in Jupyter Notebook.  
Instead of installing Apache Kafka manually, we use **Redpanda**, a lightweight and high-performance alternative.  

## ⚙️ Prerequisites  
- Docker installed and running  
- Kafka (Redpanda) running in a Docker container   
- Jupyter Notebook (or any Python environment) 
## 🔧 Steps to Follow  
1. **Start Kafka (Redpanda) using Docker**  
2. **Run the Kafka Producer to send messages**  
3. **Run the Kafka Consumer to receive messages**  
4. **Check logs for errors (if needed)**  

## 📌 Notes  
- Ensure Docker is running before starting Kafka.    
- This is a beginner-friendly project for learning Kafka messaging in Python.
